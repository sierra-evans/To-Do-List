# Overview

This is a C++ program that is designed to be a To-Do List. It allows the user to create new tasks and add them to the list, remove tasks from the list, and mark tasks as complete. The program reads from and writes to a file, so if the user exits the program, they can pick back up again where they left off the previous time. 

My purpose for writing this software was for it to be a beginner project in C++. This served as my first foray into C++ and it helped me to greatly understand the basics of the language.

# Future Work

- Implement a GUI.
- Allow user to designate if a task is high or low priority and have it display high or low on the list respectively.
- Allow user to designate category for each task, such as school, work, home, etc. Then, display the tasks under their respective category.
